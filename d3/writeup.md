I noticed that demand for each product and customer was equal each year, so removed duplicate data

Each plant can run 240 * 12 = 2880 hours with no overtime
Plant 1: 100 tons/hr -> 288000 tons
Plant 2: 50 tons/hr -> 144000 tons 
Plant 3: 50 tons/hr -> 144000 tons
Plant 4: 50 tons/hr but switching each quarter (8 days for Product 4 to 5 and 6 days for product 5 to 4),
Quarter 1: product 4 at 240 hours/month * 3 month * 50 tons = 36000 tons
Quarter 1: product 5 at 176 hours/month * 3 month * 50 tons = 26400 tons
Quarter 1: product 4 at 192 hours/month * 3 month * 50 tons = 28800 tons
Quarter 1: product 5 at 176 hours/month * 3 month * 50 tons = 26400 tons

Baseline covered customers for each product:
Product 1: 10, 19, 20, 27, 31
Product 2: 5,6,16,17,18,30,34,41,48,49
Product 3: 14,30,32,35
Product 4: 2,28,36
Product 1: 2,28,36

Scenario one formulation:
